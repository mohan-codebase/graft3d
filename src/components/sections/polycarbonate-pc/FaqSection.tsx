    question: "What is polycarbonate used for in clinical workflows?",
    answer:
      "Medical-grade polycarbonate is used for surgical guides, drill guides, anatomical models, splints, and temporary prosthetic components where strength and precision are required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is polycarbonate safe for medical and surgical use?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Medical-grade polycarbonate is biocompatible and widely used in medical devices, making it suitable for temporary and intraoperative clinical applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why choose polycarbonate over standard plastics or resins?",
    answer:
      "Polycarbonate offers superior impact resistance, higher strength, and better durability, reducing the risk of breakage during surgical handling.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is polycarbonate accurate enough for surgical guides?",
    answer:
      "Yes. It provides excellent dimensional stability and low warpage, ensuring precise fit and reliable guidance during procedures.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can polycarbonate withstand surgical handling and drilling forces?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Its high toughness and flexural strength allow it to tolerate drilling, fixation, and repeated handling without cracking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is polycarbonate compatible with sterilization protocols?",
    answer:
      "For PC filament for industrial and medical 3D prints, the page suggests extrusion around 260–310°C and bed temperature around 90–110°C, with moderate print speeds (30–60 mm/s) and enclosure/adhesion methods to reduce warping.",
