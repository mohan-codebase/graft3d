    {
        question: "What are VSP plates and how are they used in orthognathic surgery?",
        answer: "VSP plates are patient-specific fixation plates designed using virtual surgical planning to transfer the planned jaw movements accurately from the digital plan to the operating room."
    },
    {
        question: "How do VSP plates improve surgical accuracy?",
        answer: "VSP plates are designed directly from CT-based surgical simulations, ensuring precise execution of planned osteotomies and final jaw positioning without intraoperative guesswork."
    },
    {
        question: "Do VSP plates reduce operating time?",
        answer: "Yes. By eliminating manual bending, repeated measurements, and intraoperative adjustments, VSP plates help significantly reduce operative time and improve surgical workflow efficiency."
    },
    {
        question: "Are VSP plates compatible with common orthognathic techniques?",
        answer: "Yes. VSP plates are designed to support Le Fort I, BSSO, and genioplasty procedures, and can be adapted to both single-jaw and bimaxillary surgeries."
    },
    {
        question: "How do VSP plates affect intraoperative predictability?",
        answer: "VSP plates provide guided positioning and stable fixation, allowing surgeons to reproduce the virtual plan accurately and minimize intraoperative variability."
    },
    {
        question: "Can VSP plates reduce dependence on intermediate splints?",
        answer: "Yes. In many cases, VSP plates can reduce or eliminate the need for intermediate splints, simplifying surgical steps while maintaining positional accuracy."
    },
    {
        question: "How does virtual planning benefit post-operative outcomes?",
        answer: "Accurate transfer of the surgical plan leads to improved skeletal symmetry, occlusal stability, and predictable aesthetic outcomes, contributing to higher patient satisfaction."
