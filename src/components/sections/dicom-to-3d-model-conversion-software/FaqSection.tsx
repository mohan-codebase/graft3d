        question: 'What is D2P ( DICOM TO PRINT ) Modelling Software?',
        answer: 'It is an Advanced Visualization Software that allows surgeons, radiologists, lab technicians, and device designers to create diagnostic-quality digital 3D models and physical 3D prints easily and quickly. Virtual reality (VR) visualization allows clinicians and point-of-care (POC) staff to minimize the effort and time associated with the creation of patient-specific anatomic models.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What all things can we segment using D2P?',
        answer: 'D2P software has three modules: 1. Bone, 2. Teeth, 3. Vascular. It has an auto segmentation feature where you can directly segment the part in one click.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Can we directly print from D2P?',
        answer: 'Yes, we can directly print the segmented part from any 3D Systems verified printer.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the use of Virtual Reality in D2P Software?',
        answer: 'Virtual Reality is used to perform preoperative surgical planning, improve patient education, help patients manage stress, provide more detailed medical imaging, and achieve faster rehabilitation.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What Different Scanned Data can be imported to Create 3D Models?',
        answer: 'D2P uses DICOM images created by CT scans, CBCT scans, and MRI scans for creating 3D models.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What Outputs can be obtained using D2P Software?',
        answer: 'We can obtain PLY, OBJ, STL, IGES, and PDF files using D2P software. These files can be used directly in Geomagic Freeform or sent directly for 3D printing.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Is D2P Software A Perpetual Or Yearly Subscription?',
        answer: 'D2P is a one-time purchase perpetual license application; it is not available as a rental or yearly subscription.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Where can I buy D2P Software in India?',
        answer: 'You can buy D2P Software from 3D Systems authorized resellers in India. Graft3D Healthcare is one of the authorized distributors and resellers in India.'
