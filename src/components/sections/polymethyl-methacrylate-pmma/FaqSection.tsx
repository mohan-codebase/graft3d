    question: "What is medical-grade PMMA and where is it commonly used in clinical practice?",
    answer:
      "Medical-grade PMMA (Polymethyl Methacrylate) is a well-established biomaterial widely used in craniofacial reconstruction, maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, and facial contour restoration. It is preferred for patient-specific implants due to its biocompatibility, stability, and predictable clinical performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is PMMA suitable for long-term craniofacial and facial implant applications?",
    answer:
      "Yes. PMMA has a long history of safe, long-term clinical use in cranial and facial reconstructions. When properly designed and implanted, it demonstrates excellent biological tolerance, minimal tissue reaction, and long-term dimensional stability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the key mechanical properties of PMMA relevant to surgeons?",
    answer:
      "PMMA offers high compressive strength, good flexural resistance, and impact stability, making it suitable for both structural and contour-defining implants. These properties allow the implant to maintain anatomical accuracy under physiological loads without deformation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can PMMA be used for patient-specific, CT-based implant design?",
    answer:
      "Yes. PMMA is highly compatible with digital workflows, including CT/CBCT-based planning, CAD design, and 3D-manufactured implant fabrication. This enables accurate patient-specific implants, improving fit, symmetry, and surgical predictability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does PMMA compare with titanium and PEEK implants?",
    answer:
      "Compared to titanium, PMMA is lighter, radiolucent, and easier to modify intraoperatively. Compared to PEEK, PMMA offers a proven clinical track record, cost efficiency, and excellent surface finish, making it a practical option for many craniofacial and aesthetic reconstructions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is PMMA radiolucent and suitable for post-operative imaging?",
    answer:
      "Yes. PMMA is radiolucent, allowing clear visualization on CT and MRI scans without image artifacts. This supports accurate post-operative assessment, long-term follow-up, and complication monitoring.",
  },
  {
    question: "What sterilization methods are compatible with PMMA implants?",
    answer:
      "PMMA implants are compatible with standard low-temperature sterilization methods such as ethylene oxide (EtO). These methods preserve the material’s structural integrity and dimensional accuracy while ensuring clinical safety.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does PMMA contribute to reduced surgical time and improved outcomes?",
    answer:
      "By enabling pre-planned, anatomically precise implants, PMMA reduces intraoperative shaping, trial-and-error fitting, and overall surgical time. This leads to more predictable results, improved symmetry, and enhanced patient outcomes.",
